# Cube Escape 3D

3D version of Cube Escape made by Amazing Grace Cabiles. The original console version of Cube Escape was made by Amazing Grace Cabiles, Cyrelle Gapit, and Francen Manalo. The source code for the original game can be found [here](https://github.com/aaazezeze1/Final-Project-ITEC-102). The game is almost the same as the original console version but the enemies move horizontally and vertically and the obstacles do not increase after you eat 6 foods. The game also has 5 levels, if you finish level 4 but your score is not equal to 30 then the game will show a game over screen. If your score is 30 then you will spawn in the 5th level where a yellow Escape Door will spawn and if you pass through it then you win the game. This simple 3d version of the game was started in December 10, 2023 and finished in Jan 16, 2024.

# NOTE
This game was made in Windows 11 and may not work on MacOS or Linux as the developer has not tested the game in these OS platforms. 

# Game Mechanics

Press W to move forward, A to move left, S to move backward, D to move right and the Esc button to pause the game. The goal is to collect 30 foods (yellow circles) while evading the obstacles and end the game by passing through a yellow Escape Door. The Teleporter Doors (pink doors on every level) will send you to the next level if you go through it. Colliding with the walls or the obstacles is an instant game over and your high score will be displayed on the game over scene. 1 food is equal to 1 score and both the player and the obstacles get more speed in each level.
